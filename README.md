## 🧠 Project Objective  

**Business Context:**  
BMW’s sales span multiple regions, models, and fuel types, creating a rich but complex dataset. While this information holds valuable insights into market performance and consumer behavior, it can be difficult to interpret without structured analysis. The challenge lies in transforming years of scattered sales data into a clear picture of how BMW’s lineup performs across time, geography, and technology.  

**Approach:**  
This project uses data analytics to make BMW’s sales story easier to understand. Using **SQL** for data exploration and aggregation, I identified patterns such as top-performing models, yearly growth rates, and emerging sales trends. The cleaned data was then visualized in **Tableau**, highlighting regional performance, consumer preferences, and shifts in demand over time. Together, these tools turn BMW’s raw data into interactive visuals that reveal how and where the brand is growing — and where new opportunities may lie.
